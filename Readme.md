Tritiled Strap Holder
=====================

Printed in TPU with 70% fill and supports with .20mm slicing on a prusa mk3s+.

Motivation
----------

Ted Yapo (@tedyapo) said he made a circuit to blink an LED for years potentially as a replacement for the tritium vials that were being sold on gray markets.

I forget where I heard it, but he said on a podcast, he wanted to use it for Astrophotography to mark the tripod legs in the dark.

So I'm fortunate to have tritiled, and I made just such a strap. 

Info
----

Use freecad to adjust the Constraints worksheet, and it should create a band to your specifications.

Enjoy!
